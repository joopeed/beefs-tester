Beehive File System tester


Beehive File System ( lsd.ufcg.edu.br/beefs ) is a distributed file system for local area networks (LANs) 
that is both scalable and simple to maintain. It is being developed at Distributed Systems Laboratory (LSD) 
at Federal University of Campina Grande, Brazil.

This tester will analyze the behavior of BeeFS into different situations
(including changing the mode of file synchronization, workloads and so on),
will allow execute performance tests more mechanically and generate more results in less time
